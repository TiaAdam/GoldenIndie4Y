          The company has also expanded into online distribution, through online
          video on demand rental services, first in partnership with MUBI
          (formerly known as The Auteurs), then Hulu. Criterion's Hulu Plus
          subscription channel also offered titles for streaming as-yet
          unreleased on DVD/Blu-ray, including dozens of the Janus-owned films
          produced by London Films. In November 2016, Criterion ended its deal
          with Hulu, and partnered with Turner Classic Movies to launch a
          dedicated streaming service called FilmStruck.[43][44] After two
          years, TCM parent company WarnerMedia restructured its streaming
          offerings, and it was announced that the future online home for
          Criterion's films would be a dedicated channel. The Criterion Channel
          launched on April 8, 2019 and offers subscribers access to both
          'complete' releases from the collection, specially-produced
          supplementary programming and other films controlled by Janus/Voyager,
          alongside limited engagements of select films from other companies,
          particularly Warner/TCM.[45] Criterion Collection content is also
          accessible via the library VOD service Kanopy.
